## Task

The task has two stages:

1. **Debugging**

   The project has errors in it, on purpose.

   Your task is to get the project to a running state. It should work without any errors.

   You should fix the errors.

   Please don't spend more than 45 minutes on this task.

2. **Design**

   After fixing the errors, your task is to improve the design of the example blog page using Tailwind CSS. It is under the path "/blog"

   There's no specific guidelines for this. We want to see how you design. You are free to use any libraries or design resources that you like.

   Please don't spend more than 45 minutes on this task.

## Solution

Please watch solution.mp4 that shows the final version for the debugging part. The test page works and makes a successful API request.

We did not provide an example for the design part to not affect you. We want to see what you will come up with.
